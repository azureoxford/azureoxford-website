### "3 Lessons Learned from a Decade of DevOps" - with [Chris Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjj/)

_"DevOps... Is it a state of mind? Is it a job description? Is it a portfolio of open source tools? Is it the product of a great marketing team? In this talk, we will share experiences of building DevOps capability in small organisations and FTSE-100 enterprises. We will also address some proven ideas for kick-starting your own DevOps plans and most importantly... how to get the leaders in your business to invest in it properly!"_

### "An Introduction to Azure DevOps" - with [Dan Clarke](https://twitter.com/dracan)

_"Azure DevOps covers a variety of things - from agile project management and issue tracking, to CI/CD, to hosting your source-code, and much more. In this talk, we'll be delving into each of the Azure DevOps "Services", explaining what each one is and how they work. This is not a high-level vague abstract talk - instead, it'll be quite demo-heavy, showing how you use it, and how it all fits together. By the end of this talk, you'll have a good understanding of how to use Azure DevOps in both your workplace and also your personal projects."_
