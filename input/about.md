Title: "About Azure Oxford"
---
Azure Oxford is a user-group based in the UK for users of the Microsoft cloud platform, [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).

It was founded in 2019 by [Dan Clarke](https://www.twitter.com/dracan) and [James World](https://www.twitter.com/jamesw0rld), and has spawned off as a sister-user group from [.NET Oxford](https://www.dotnetoxford.com).

Whilst anybody is welcome, the group is primarily targeted for developers.

Our primary sponsor is [Corriculo Recruitment](https://corriculo.co.uk/). They are also the primary sponsors of our sister user-group, [.NET Oxford](https://www.dotnetoxford.com), and help us out in so many different ways. Financially with the venue costs and providing drinks and refreshments for all our events. At each event, helping welcome everyone in through the doors and serving drinks. And also behind the scenes with marketing and promotion, ideas and suggestions. Definitely a core part of both Azure Oxford and .NET Oxford!{style='float: left'}

### Everstack Ltd

Our secondary sponsor is Dan's company, [Everstack Ltd](https://www.everstack.com). For .NET Oxford, providing tons of Dan's time to manage and organise the user-group. Everstack provides software development and consultation services - please see [our website](https://www.everstack.com) for more information.{style='float: left'}

### Prize Draw sponsors

We also do a monthly prize draw, and our prize draw sponsors are:

* [Manning Publications](https://manning.com)
* _(more to come soon!)_

### Photography

Whilst not _technically_ a sponsor - we'd also like to say a massive thank you to [John Parkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrparkin/) for his help with the photography. He's very kindly offered to help out with photography for each meetup - which is fantastic, as decent pictures of the events were something we were really lacking previously!
