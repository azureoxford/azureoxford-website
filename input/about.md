## Sponsors

### Corriculo Recruitment

Our primary sponsor is [Corriculo Recruitment](https://corriculo.co.uk/). They have been our main sponsors from the very start, helping us out in so many different ways. Financially with the venue costs and providing drinks and refreshments for all our events. At each event, helping welcome everyone in through the doors and serving drinks. And also behind the scenes with marketing and promotion, ideas and suggestions. Definitely a core part of both the Azure Oxford and .NET Oxford team!{style='float: left'}

### Everstack Ltd

Everstack provides software development and consultation services - please see [our website](https://www.everstack.com) for more information.{style='float: left'}

### Photography

Whilst not _technically_ a sponsor - we'd also like to say a massive thank you to [John Parkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrparkin/) for his help with the photography. He's very kindly offered to help out with photography for each meetup - which is fantastic, as decent pictures of the events were something we were really lacking previously!
